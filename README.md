## Hotel-Reservation-Data-Analysis
**Data Analysis Project**

This project involves the analysis of hotel management data to derive insights about room types, booking channels, rates, and guest preferences. The analysis is visualized using an interactive Power BI dashboard to help stakeholders make data-driven decisions.

### 1. Project Overview
This project aims to explore key operational metrics and customer behaviors in the hotel industry. The dataset includes information on room types, reservation statuses, booking channels, rate types, and special requests.

#### Key Objectives:
Understand room occupancy trends across different room types.
Analyze the performance of various booking channels.
Examine the impact of advanced bookings and special requests on overall customer satisfaction.
Provide a summary of KPIs relevant to hotel management.

### 2. Dashboard
#### Dashboard Highlights:
The interactive dashboard presents the following insights:

**Room Type Occupancy** : Visualization of room type preferences among guests, highlighting which room types are most frequently booked.  
**Booking Channel Performance** : A comparison of online, offline, and third-party booking channels, identifying which channel drives the most reservations.  
**Reservation Status** : Analysis of booking statuses (e.g., confirmed, canceled, no-shows), showcasing trends over time.  
**Rate Type Comparison** : Insights into the performance of different rate types, such as standard, discounted, or promotional rates.  
**Property Performance** : A performance evaluation of different properties based on occupancy rates, revenue, and guest feedback.  
**Advanced Booking Trends** : An analysis of the lead time for reservations and its impact on occupancy rates.  
**Impact of Special Requests** : Insights into how special requests (e.g., early check-ins, late check-outs) affect guest satisfaction and operational efficiency.  

### 3. Summary
#### Key Findings:
**High Demand for Standard Rooms** : Single & Double room types were the most booked across all properties, accounting for around 50% of total room bookings.  
**Dominance of Online Booking Channels** : Online platforms (including the hotel's website and third-party aggregators) accounted for more than 70% of bookings, making them the primary source of reservations.  
**Impact of Cancellation Policies** : Strict cancellation policies led to fewer cancellations, but no-show rates remained consistent, indicating the need for further strategy adjustments.  
**Effect of Rate Flexibility** : Promotional rates had a significant impact on booking volumes, particularly during off-peak seasons, suggesting that dynamic pricing strategies can drive higher occupancy.  
**Guest Preferences for Special Requests** : Over 40% of guests made special requests, with early check-in being the most common. Properties that could accommodate these requests saw a 15% increase in positive feedback.  

### 4. Conclusion
The analysis provides crucial insights into the performance of hotel operations, guest preferences, and booking behaviors. The findings can be used to optimize pricing strategies, improve booking channels, and enhance guest satisfaction by accommodating special requests.
